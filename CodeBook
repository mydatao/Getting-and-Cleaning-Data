The attached R script (run_analysis.R) clean up the data:

* 1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set, namely train/X_train.txt with test/X_test.txt, the
result of which is a 10299x561 data frame, with a Number of Instances of 10299, and Number of Attributes: 561, 
the result is a data frame of 10299 x 1 with subject IDs, and the file train/y_train.txt with test/y_test.txt,
the result is a data frame of 10299 x 1 with activity IDs.

* 2. Reads features.txt and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
The result is a 10299x66 data frame, only 66 out of 561 attributes are measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
All measurements are floating point numbers in the range of -1, and 1.

* 3. Reads activity_labels.txt and applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:

walking
walkingupstairs
walkingdownstairs
sitting
standing
laying

* 4. The script labels the data set with descriptive names: all feature names (attributes) and activity names are converted
to lower case, underscores and brackets () are removed. Then it generate a data frame of 10299x66 containing features 
with 10299x1 data frames containing activity labels and subject IDs. 
The result is saved as merged_clean_data.txt, with a data frame of  10299x68 whre the first column contains subject IDs, the second
column activity names, and the last 66 columns are measurements. The subject IDs are integers between 1 and 30.
The names of the attributes looks like to the following:

tbodyacc-mean-x
tbodyacc-mean-y
tbodyacc-mean-z
tbodyacc-std-x
tbodyacc-std-y
tbodyacc-std-z
tgravityacc-mean-x
tgravityacc-mean-y

* 5. The script creates a tidy data set with the average of each measurement for each
for each subject. The result is saved as data_set_with_the_averages.txt, with a data frame of 180x68,
where the first column contains subject IDs, the second column contains activity names, and then the
averages for each of the 66 attributes are in columns 3 to 68. There are 30 subjects and 6 activities, with 180 rows
in this data set with averages.
